for Josh's code I noticed that his closing braces were not not indented properly. I also noticed that he was using a for
loop to indent rather than just using the '\t' symbol. Next, I noticed that he does not check for when there is a closing
brace, so I added an if statement and every time, there was a closing brace, indentation was reduced by one.
